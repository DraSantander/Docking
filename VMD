How to use VMD

VMD is a software, we can use for RMSD calculation

For validation of Docking methodology we need to compare the cristalized-ligand with the re-docked ligand.

first: open VMD in the folder with ligand_out.pdbqt Vina results.
split the file with

bash
vina_split --input ligand_out.pdbqt

this will generate nine files, one for each conformer
ligand_out_1.pdbqt .......

transform in .mol2

bash
obabel -i pdbqt ligand_out_*.pdbqt -o mol2 ligand_out_.mol2 -m

open VMD
bash
vmd

file >  new molecule > browser > load
extensions > analysis > RMSD calculator

write
all > clink on > aling > RMSD

interpretation
RMSD < 2  - perfect
RMSD 2-3  - acceptable
RMSD >3   - Not good
